# distribution

This is the distribution library. When loaded, distribution introduces functionality supporting the distributed execution of programs. To download it:

## Installation

```sh
$ npm i '@brown-ds/distribution'
```

This command downloads and installs the distribution library.

## Testing

There are several categories of tests:
  *	Regular Tests (`*.test.js`)
  *	Scenario Tests (`*.scenario.js`)
  *	Extra Credit Tests (`*.extra.test.js`)

### Running Tests

By default, all regular tests are run. Use the options below to run different sets of tests:

1. Run all regular tests (default): `$ npm test` or `$ npm test -- -t`
2. Run scenario tests: `$ npm test -- -c` 
3. Run extra credit tests: `$ npm test -- -ec`
4. Run the `non-distribution` tests: `$ npm test -- -nd`
5. Combine options: `$ npm test -- -c -ec -nd -t`

## Usage

To import the library, be it in a JavaScript file or on the interactive console, run:

```js
let distribution = require("@brown-ds/distribution");
```

Now you have access to the full distribution library. You can start off by serializing some values. 

```js
let s = distribution.util.serialize(1); // '{"type":"number","value":"1"}'
let n = distribution.util.deserialize(s); // 1
```

You can inspect information about the current node (for example its `sid`) by running:

```js
distribution.local.status.get('sid', console.log); // 8cf1b
```

You can also store and retrieve values from the local memory:

```js
distribution.local.mem.put({name: 'nikos'}, 'key', console.log); // {name: 'nikos'}
distribution.local.mem.get('key', console.log); // {name: 'nikos'}
```

You can also spawn a new node:

```js
let node = { ip: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080 };
distribution.local.status.spawn(node, console.log);
```

Using the `distribution.all` set of services will allow you to act 
on the full set of nodes created as if they were a single one.

```js
distribution.all.status.get('sid', console.log); // { '8cf1b': '8cf1b', '8cf1c': '8cf1c' }
```

You can also send messages to other nodes:

```js
distribution.all.comm.send(['sid'], {node: node, service: 'status', method: 'get'}, console.log); // 8cf1c
```

## Summary

> Summarize your implementation, including the most challenging aspects; remember to update the `report` section of the `package.json` file with the total number of hours it took you to complete M0 (`hours`), the total number of JavaScript lines you added, including tests (`jsloc`), the total number of shell lines you added, including for deployment and testing (`sloc`).


My implementation consists of 6 components addressing T1--8. The most challenging aspect was process because it was my first time writing in bash. It was also very finicky and error prone which made it more difficult.


## Correctness & Performance Characterization


> Describe how you characterized the correctness and performance of your implementation.


To characterize correctness, we developed 8 that test the following cases:
- getText: regular html file with head and body, find text
- getURLs: regular html file with href tags, find urls
- merge: go through 2 local files and merge them
- stem: basic words, find the stem of them
- process: basic paragraph, call the function on it. This paragraph contains a word that is a substring of the test dataset
- query: case with 1 word
- query: case with 2 words
- query: case with 3 words


*Performance*: The throughput of various subsystems is described in the `"throughput"` portion of package.json. The characteristics of my development machines are summarized in the `"dev"` portion of package.json.


## Wild Guess

> How many lines of code do you think it will take to build the fully distributed, scalable version of your search engine? Add that number to the `"dloc"` portion of package.json, and justify your answer below.

I think it will be 1500. I don't think it will be that heavy but the tests will make up a large portion of the loc. I also think there will be more tests as time goes on which is why the number is so high.

## Summary

> Summarize your implementation, including key challenges you encountered. Remember to update the `report` section of the `package.json` file with the total number of hours it took you to complete each task of M1 (`hours`) and the lines of code per task.


My implementation comprises `<number>` software components, totaling `<number>` lines of code. Key challenges included `<1, 2, 3 + how you solved them>`.


## Correctness & Performance Characterization


> Describe how you characterized the correctness and performance of your implementation


*Correctness*: I wrote `<number>` tests; these tests take `<time>` to execute. This includes objects with `<certain kinds of features>`.


*Performance*: The latency of various subsystems is described in the `"latency"` portion of package.json. The characteristics of my development machines are summarized in the `"dev"` portion of package.json.
